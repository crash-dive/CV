<span class=employer-name>Fleet Assist</span>
<span class=employment-time>Nov 2009 to Jan 2020 </span>
<span class=employment-duration>(10 yrs 3 mos)</span>
</div>
</div>
<div class=employment-description>
<p>I joined Fleet Assist as a small family business of 10 people with the task of professionalising their IT and security setup. Over the next 10 years we grew it into a 50 employee multi-million revenue provider of services to the automotive finance industry.</p>
<p>Initially I performed all IT roles for the business, including software development, database design and IT. As we grew the business and I built my teams I evolved the role into a senior executive who designed and led the technology vision for the company. This experience means I have an unusually broad technical skill-set that allows me to lead technological change from the front. Right until my last day I was deeply involved in technical choices and continued to be hands-on in all aspects of the businessâ technological journey.</p>
<p>My responsibilities at Fleet Assist included:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class=employment-skill>People Management</span>: I was line manager for 6 direct reports and secondary manager for their teams. This covered the IT, Software Development, Analytics, Data Administration and Vehicle Procurement departments.</li>
<li><span class=employment-skill>Mentorship</span>: I provided mentorship to all staff and greatly enjoyed doing so. I was particularly successful in organising and then guiding colleagues through technical training, including through apprenticeships and industry certification programs. This covered the full range of technology skills, taking in software development, IT and DBA training programs. The impact I had on the staff I helped train is my most proud legacy from my time at Fleet Assist and I look forward to doing it again in the future.</li>
<li><span class=employment-skill>Software Development</span>: I designed, developed, project managed and delivered all software development projects. Initially I was the sole developer, meaning I have extensive full stack skill set. Even as the developer team grew I still personally reviewed all code before it entered into production. I predominantly work using a Microsoft stack of C#, ASP.NET Core & MSSQL, but have gained skills in other areas as required.</li>
<li><span class=employment-skill>Data Analytics</span>: I designed and built an award winning data analytics platform to process over Â£1.5bn in automotive maintenance data. Then I led a data team which provided our internal and external stakeholders actionable insights on their data. I would also act as the companyâs face for presentations about data and give regular talks at ours and industry events.</li>
<li><span class=employment-skill>IT</span>: I provided a modern and secure IT infrastructure for the company's software to run on, this needed to meet the high security standards of our FCA regulated financial services customers. This included providing secure PCs for the staff and servers for our line of business applications to run on. A highlight of this was building a secure on-site server room within a decommissioned bank vault. This used Hyper-V running Windows Server VMs and linked to MS Azure to create a hybrid cloud solution for both our staff and customers.</li>
<li><span class=employment-skill>Networking & Telephony</span>: I designed, procured and configured a Juniper based network and maintained an Avaya PABX for our 20 seat call centre.</li>
<li><span class=employment-skill>Sales & Customer Relations</span>: As the senior technical leader I played a key role selling our software and data products to customers. I would work with the sales team to provide clear demonstrations of the product to senior executives and then ensure their onboarding process went smoothly.</li>
<li><span class=employment-skill>Tender & Communication</span>: As a practiced technology communicator who would regularly attend and speak at industry events, I became the lead tender writer. This involved owning the writing and style of tenders that were sent out by the sales department, the success of these tenders in regularly winning new business demonstrated my strong written skills.</li>
<li><span class=employment-skill>Budget & Risk Management</span>: I held responsibility for our IT and facilities budget. Furthermore I provided financial risk management and final sign off on our multi-million vehicle supply business.</li>
<li><span class=employment-skill>Facilities</span>: I managed the company's facilities, which included project managing the head office refurbishment and relocation in 2018.</li>

</div>
<div class=employment-description>
<p>In 2016 the 2 original founders of Fleet Assist decided they would like to exit the business. To realise this I worked in partnership with the commercial director to engineer a sale of the business.</p>
<p>During this process I led the pitches to investors alongside the commercial director and through the strength of this process was able to bring in multiple credible offers from a wide variety of vendors. This competition for the business allowed us to deliver a very strong multiple and resulted in the sale of the business to a private equity group.</p>
<p>After the sale I became a director of the business where I helped pilot it through its next 3 years delivering strong growth and putting in the foundations for my eventual exit in 2020.</p>
<p>My time as a director gave me even greater commercial experience of all areas of business, however one area of particular note is I became extensively involved in further M&A and refinancing activities. This has given me a great deal of experience in company accounts, talking with investors, raising capital and the sale of businesses.</p>

<div class=employment-description>
<p>I started coaching during my time at university before starting to coach professionally when I returned to Kettering. During this time I built my leadership and training skills to become a senior coach who planned and ran classes of 30+ gymnasts. As the senior coach I would be in charge of the sessions requiring me to not only coach, but manage junior coaches and liaise with parents.</p>
<p>I have gained numerous educational qualifications during my time as a coach. These include Level 3 Trampoline, Level 3 Freestyle Gymnastics, Level 1 Men's Artistic Gymnastics & Level 1 Diving.</p>
<p>This role has given me extensive experience in how to teach new skills to both the young and old. This is something I regularly draw on as a technology leader, where it is important that your team must be constantly learning to keep up with the rapid pace of technological change.</p>

<p>I attended Aberystwyth on their competitively awarded Open Scholarship. This was gained through doing extra specialised examinations set by the university prior admission.</p>
<p>I graduated with a 1<sup>st</sup> class classification, with a highlight being in my final year achieving 1<sup>st</sup>s in all modules thereby achieving a 73.5 average for that year.</p>
<p>My primary focus during university was on the role the internet plays in political life and Middle Eastern political history. Funded by the competitively gained Gregynog Travelling Award I spent time studying Arabic in Jordan, Syria & Lebanon in 2008. This experience of studying and travelling alone in the region led me to decide to focus on the IT side of my interests and decision led me into my career in technology.</p>
<p>Alongside academic success I was also an active part of university life, including roles as the secretary of Model UN, communications officer for the university Amnesty International and head coach/president of the trampoline club.</p> </div>
