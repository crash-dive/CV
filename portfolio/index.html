I designed and built the entire system from a greenfield project right through to it running all areas of the company's operations.</p><p class=description>As a predominantly private system I am unfortunately only able to share publicly available screenshots from the system in this portfolio.</p><p class=description>Starting development in 2012 the system was built using C# .NET. I always ensured the system was updated to reflect the state of the art within the .NET ecosystem and as .NET Core was developed we migrated onto that as it was released in 2016 and then subsequently onto .NET 5 in 2020.</p><p class=description>Built on a Microsoft stack we followed a domain focused CQRS architecture using technologies such as Entity Framework, LESS, TypeScript, ADO.NET, SQL Server, Razor and Autofac. We further intergrated with a wide range of well known external services such as MapBox, Mailgun, TextLocal, Avaya PABX and internal customer systems.</p><p class=description>The application was very data and process centric. To manage the company's processes I built a custom task system that could be configured in real time using a diagram of the process. Then to manage the large amounts of data we built a database of garages and vehicle data which won multiple industry accolades.</p><p class=description>Working as a solo developer for the first few years I became a true full stack developer able to work on any area of the system and continued to develop the system right until the end of my time at Fleet Assist.</p></details><div class=links><div class=deployed><img width=20 height=20 src=/img/icons/others/web-black.min.svg alt="Weblink icon">

This can be best seen on this page in the image carousel built using TypeScript and CSS.</p><p class=description>Furthermore the site is fully responsive allowing the user to view it on desktop or mobile. As well as providing print stylings designed to create an A4 CV when printed.</p><p class=description>Graphically the site uses a large number of SVGs that are used to provide colour to the pages. These were all hand edited and optimised for web use.</p><p class=description>It is deployed using a basic DevOps pipeline based on Github actions. On commit this builds all assets using Hugo and publishes it as a GitHub page.</p></details><div class=links><div class=deployed><img width=20 height=20 src=/img/icons/others/web-black.min.svg alt="Weblink icon">

This is done by publishing the sheets as CSVs and then pulling them down in JavaScript to render them on the page in HTML. It makes extensive use of the tabulator and papaparse libraries to do this.</p><p class=description>This architecture allowed me to keep using Google Sheets to track my collections and use a static site hosting option to reduce costs but still provide an interactive backend.</p><p class=description>I often link to pages on the site when talking on Facebook and wanted the site to have full Open Graph support. However Open Graph requires a raster image of the page to show when rendering the preview, the large number of games made creating this image manually very time consuming.</p><p class=description>To address this I created a part of the build step that generates these images from a HTML page when a new game is added. It does this by running an NPM task using the headless chrome puppeteer tool to render the page and extracting the images from that page.</p></details><div class=links><div class=deployed><img width=20 height=20 src=/img/icons/others/web-black.min.svg alt="Weblink icon">
