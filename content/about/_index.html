            <span class="employer-name">Fleet Assist</span>
            <span class="employment-time">Nov 2009 to Jan 2020 </span>
            <span class="employment-duration">(10 yrs 3 mos)</span>
        </div>
    </div>
    <div class="employment-description">
        <p>I joined Fleet Assist as a small family business of 10 people with the task of professionalising their IT and security setup. Over the next 10 years we grew it into a 50 employee multi-million revenue business.</p>
        <p>The role evolved and changed as the company grew, this means I gained an unusually broad IT skill-set. I have developed the ability to not only manage IT tasks, but also perform and therefore understand them on a deep technical level. Equally at home as a software developer, database designer, IT sysadmin, network engineer or board level manager, I have a level of breadth and depth of knowledge to tackle almost all IT tasks.</p>
        <p>In the later years I took a seat on the board as an executive director and an equity stake in the business. Then with the rest of the management team sold the business to investors in 2017 and after a transition period departed in January 2020.</p>
        <p>My responsibilities at Fleet Assist included:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><span class="employment-skill">Software Development</span>: I designed, project managed and delivered all software development projects. This was done using a predominantly Microsoft stack of C#, ASP.NET Core & MSSQL.</li>
            <li><span class="employment-skill">Data Analytics</span>: I designed and built an award winning data analytics platform to process over £1.5bn in automotive maintenance data. Then I led a data team which provided our internal and external stakeholders actionable insights on their data. I would also act as the company’s face for presentations about data and give regular talks at ours and industry events.</li>
            <li><span class="employment-skill">IT</span>: I provided a modern and secure IT infrastructure for the companies software to run on, this needed to meet the high security standards of our FCA regulated financial services customers. This included providing secure PCs for the staff and servers for our line of business applications to run on. A highlight of this was building a secure on-site server room within a decommissioned bank vault. This used Hyper-V running Windows Server VMs and linked to MS Azure to create a hybrid cloud solution for both our staff and customers.</li>
            <li><span class="employment-skill">Networking & Telephony</span>: Working with external partners I designed a Juniper based network and Avaya PABX for our 20 seat call centre.</li>
            <li><span class="employment-skill">People Management</span>: I was line manager for 6 direct reports across the IT, Software Development, Analytics, Data Administration and Vehicle Procurement departments. In this role I provided mentorship to all staff, but particularly in technical roles where I guided members of staff through apprenticeships and industry certification programs.</li>
            <li><span class="employment-skill">Sales & Customer Relations</span>: As the senior technical leader I played a key role selling our software and data products to customers. I would work with the sales team to provide clear demonstrations of the product to senior executives and then ensure their onboarding process went smoothly.</li>
            <li><span class="employment-skill">Investor Relations</span>: In partnership with the Managing Director I led sale and refinancing efforts for the business, giving me solid experience raising money and selling businesses.</li>
            <li><span class="employment-skill">Budget & Risk Management</span>: I held responsibility for our IT and facilities budget. Furthermore I provided financial risk management and final sign off on our multi-million vehicle supply business.</li>
            <li><span class="employment-skill">Facilities</span>: I managed the companies facilities, which included project managing the head office relocation in 2018.</li>
